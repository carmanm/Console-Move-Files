# Console-Move-Files
Transfer files using the moveFiles(src, dest) function if they were edited in the past 24 hours.  The "src" and "dest" parameters are paths
in string format that transfers the content of a folder if they were created or edited in the past 24 hours.  This is a console variation of 
the "FileTransferator" project.  Thanks for checking it out!
